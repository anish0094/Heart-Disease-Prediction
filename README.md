<h1>Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project to predict heart disease using logistic regression. The project achieves an accuracy of almost 85% on a public dataset.

<h3>Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explores various machine learning models for heart disease prediction, including logistic regression, K neighbours, random forest.</li>
<li>Compares the performance of these models on a public dataset and finds that logistic regression performs the best.</li>
<li>Provides code and examples for using each model.</li>
<li>Explores various feature selection techniques to improve the performance of the machine learning models.</li>
<li>Provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning for heart disease prediction.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Getting started:</h3>

To get started with this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:
<ul>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
